<h1>Zesstra's Diary</h1>
<h2>Friday, November 9th, 2018</h2>

<p>	I first go back to the stronghold to find Ruben. He wasn't there so I got a brown horse with brown hair and starting to go towards
where I hear they were. It took me a bit to get there but when I finally got there, it was a masscre. I was able to get to Reuben and Slave and use Pass w/o Trace.
We leave. After healing up, we come across some spiders. I attempt to try and make friends with them using Animal Friendship. The spiders did not take it too friendly, so they go into attack mode.
The spiders disappear into the nether and then appear right in front of me. I tried to combat with a flaming spear but it was not enough. With their two bites I was taken down. I failed the first saving through.
Rubuen used a spell that got rid of the poision and gave me 20 health. With that I was able to turn into a dire wolf and take out one of the spiders ("I'm the big bad wolf and I'm going to blow the spiders down!"). After we all defeated the spiders, I morned them since I didn't 
want to kill them in the first place. We found two dead bodies, a women and a man, dead with some scrolls, money, and a broken cart. I was able to fix the cart with mending and we took all the spider bodies to town.
We asked the local potion shop to take the spiders to make potions out of. Afterwards, we went back to the hostil. I went up to the room with Katrina while everyone else stayed downstairs to drink. As soon as I was alone with Katrina, she pulls
a knife on my throat and says "If you put the group in danger again, I will take out your gut!". My reaction was "How are you going to cut my gut if the knife is at my throat!". She takes the knife down and makes a long eight inch
mark on my chest. After Katrina leaves, Simon comes in with the food and drinks. He apparently feels scared of Katrina (so does everyone else). He doens't feel that Slav has the same kind of followage as the others. He heals me with his healing kit and does back down
to the bar to join the others. Everyone stays downstairs and drinks and smokes all night long...</p>
