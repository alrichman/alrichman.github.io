<p>After the fight, we travel back to the fortress and we sense that it is under attack. As we aproach the land we see multiplegroups (orcs & paladins).
WE ATTACK! I choose ot go as a dire wolf. I bite some people, i get an advantage when I bite osmeone that na allay is attacking. Our leader, Clath, gets injured by a balista.</p>
